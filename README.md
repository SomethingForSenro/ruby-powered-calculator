These are your options for methods, written letter for letter. Don't include the 'single quotes' or any other symbols when typing the value.

1) 'addition':
Add two addends together!
2) 'subtraction':
Subtract two numbers! The number you're subtracting from is called the 'menuend', and the number by which you're subtracting is the 'subtrehend'.
3) 'multiplication':
Multiply the multiplicand by the multiplier!
4) 'division':
Divide the dividend by the divisor!
5) 'exponent':
Put the base to the power of the exponent!
6) 'root':
Put a number to the nth root! The number you're taking the root of is called the 'radicand', and the value of the root is called the 'index'.
7) 'logarithm':
Find the nth log of a number! The value of the log is called the 'base', and the number you're getting the log of is called the 'argument'.
8) 'tetration':
Ooh, fancy! Put the 'base' to the power of itself a certain number of times. The number of times you put it to the power of itself is called the 'tetrator'. For example, "2 tetrated to 3" is the same as 2^2^2.
9) 'sin':
Find the sine of a number! The input should be in radians.
10) 'cos':
Find the cosine of a number! The input should be in radians.
11) 'tan':
Find the tangent of a number! The input should be in radians.
12) 'sec':
Find the secant of a number! The input should be in radians.
13) 'csc':
Find the cosecant of a number! The input should be in radians.
14) 'cot':
Find the cotangent of a number! The input should be in radians.
15) 'hypotenuse':
A classic math problem! When you have the lengths of both rays of a right triangle, how long is the hypotenuse? Now you can find out! Put in the lengths of both rays, and the program will return the length of the hypotenuse.
